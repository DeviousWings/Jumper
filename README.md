## What I learned
I learned how to develop a working software by programming with classes, and Develop a working program that controls access to class members. This assignemnet was to help create
from scratch code to play a hangman type game using the encapsulation method.

## Getting Started
Make sure you have Python 3.8.0 or newer installed and running on your machine. Open a terminal and browse to the project's root folder. Start the program by running the following command.
```
python3 seeker 
```
You can also run the program from an IDE like Visual Studio Code. Start your IDE and open the project folder. Select the main module inside the hunter folder and click the "run" icon.

## Project Structure
The project files and folders are organized as follows:
```
root                    (project root folder)
+-- jumper              (source code for game)
  +-- game              (specific classes)
  +-- __main__.py       (program entry point)
+-- README.md           (general info)
```
